## <span class="dark:text-white">What is Astro?</span>

Astro is a web framework that aims to <span class="font-bold">be performant</span>. According to its own <a target="_blank" href="https://docs.astro.build/en/concepts/why-astro/" class="dark:text-white dark:hover:text-gray-100"> documentation</a>, it pioneered the <a target="_blank" href="https://docs.astro.build/en/concepts/islands/" class="dark:text-white dark:hover:text-gray-100">islands architecture</a>, which aims to reduce the clutter and complexity of client-side JavaScript.

Let's dive into the technical details of this architecture: <br />
Astro's islands architecture is a way of building pages that consist of static parts and interactive parts, which we can understand and refer to as islands. Follow along with the following figure:

<img src="/astro-islands.png" />

We can simplify it by understanding that each box in the image represents a component. Thus, we have 2 interactive components/islands and 3 static components/islands.

Important considerations about islands:

1. An island runs in isolation from other islands on the page.
2. There can be multiple islands on the same page.
3. Due to Astro's support for <a target="_blank" href="https://docs.astro.build/en/guides/integrations-guide/#official-integrations" class="dark:text-white dark:hover:text-gray-100">multiple frameworks</a>, such as React, Vue, Svelte... It is possible, through the island architecture, to have multiple frameworks on a single page. Which can be an advantage if you have more than one developer on the project, want to learn a new framework without starting a project from scratch, or even migrating frameworks without downtime.

<br />

Additionally, by default, Astro automatically renders all UI components statically, meaning only as HTML and CSS, removing all client-side JavaScript. It may seem like an exaggeration, but it is very common for us as developers to send more JavaScript to the client side than necessary during development.

```jsx
<MyReactComponent />
```

To turn a static UI component into an interactive island is quite simple and requires just one property, `client:*`. Astro will automatically build and package client-side JavaScript for optimized performance.

```jsx
<!-- This component is now interactive on the page!
     The rest of your website remains static. -->
<MyComponentReact client:load />
```

We can use `client:load` , `client:only` , `client:idle`, `client:visible` and each property has its peculiarity that you can read in more detail <a target="_blank" href="https://docs.astro .build/en/reference/directives-reference/#client-directives" class="dark:text-white dark:hover:text-gray-100">here</a>.

You may have noticed that this functionality is quite similar to React's <a target="_blank" href="https://react.dev/reference/rsc/server-components" class="dark:text-white dark:hover:text-gray-100 ">_server components_</a> and the <a target="_blank" href="https://react.dev/reference/rsc/use-client" class="dark:text-white dark:hover:text-gray-100" >_'use client'_</a> directive. However, in my opinion, Astro is a simpler and less bloated framework compared to React, making it a better choice for a simple blog like mine. I will discuss this topic futher in the next <a target="_blank" href="#why-did-i-choose-astro-and-what-were-the-other-options" class="dark:text-white dark:hover:text- gray-100">section</a>.

In my opinion, it is the combination of these two features that makes Astro performant and provides a great development experience.

In short, about Astro:

1. Server first, taking rendering off users devices.
2. Zero JS by default.
3. Content Collections: Organizes, validates, and provides TypeScript type safety for your Markdown content.
4. Customizable: Provides several integrations with popular tools, including <a target="_blank" href="https://docs.astro.build/en/guides/integrations-guide/tailwind/" class="dark:text-white dark:hover:text-gray-100">Tailwind</a> and <a target="_blank" href="https://docs.astro.build/en/guides/typescript/" class="dark:text-white dark:hover:text-gray-100">Typescript</a> very easily. See other integrations <a target="_blank" href="https://docs.astro.build/en/guides/integrations-guide/" class="dark:text-white dark:hover:text-gray-100">here</a>.

## <span class="dark:text-white">Why did I choose Astro and what were the other options?</span>

I was looking for something simple and modern where I could use <a target="_blank" href="https://react.dev/" class="dark:text-white dark:hover:text-gray-100">React.js </a>, a tool that I've been working with for the past few years. So, my options were:

1. A standalone React.js application, but I was concerned that I might lose support and features, since <a target="_blank" href="https://react.dev/learn/start-a-new-react- project" class="dark:text-white dark:hover:text-gray-100">React documentation</a> recommends using frameworks. ‚ùå
2. Using a React.js framework, in which case there would be options like <a target="_blank" href="https://www.gatsbyjs.com/" class="dark:text-white dark:hover:text-gray-100">Gatsby</a> and <a target="_blank" href="https://remix.run/" class="dark:text-white dark:hover:text-gray-100">Remix</a>. However, since I had previously worked with <a target="_blank" href="https://nextjs.org/" class="dark:text-white dark:hover:text-gray-100">Next.js</a>, it would be the framework that I would choose. But the purpose of this site is to be a simple blog where I can share some of my knowledge and express my opinions on technical topics. I realized that choosing Next.js in its current state would be like using a bazooka to kill an ant. I can barely keep up with the news that the framework launches every 6 months, wouldn't my blog suffer for that? ‚ùå
3. Finally, I found Astro, which seemed like exactly what I needed: a simple, performant web framework that I could use React.js. ‚úÖ

We can create Astro components and pages with the `.astro` extension, which has a syntax very familiar to current frameworks. For example, see the rendering of the pages of each article on my blog:

```jsx
---
import { getCollection, type CollectionEntry } from "astro:content";
import BlogPost from "../../../layouts/BlogPost.astro";

export async function getStaticPaths() {
  const posts = await getCollection("ptbrblog");
  return posts.map((post) => ({
    params: { slug: post.slug },
    props: post,
  }));
}
type Props = CollectionEntry<"ptbrblog">;

const post = Astro.props;
const { Content } = await post.render();
---

<BlogPost {...post.data}>
  <Content />
</BlogPost>

```

I don't know about you, but to me, it looks very similar to a React.js page, and even the `getStaticPaths` function resembles Next.js's own `getStaticPaths`.

It is also possible to create components with the `.tsx` extension and use React. Here's an example:

```tsx
import React from "react";

interface TitleProps {
  id?: string;
  children: React.ReactNode;
}

export const Title = ({ id, children }: TitleProps) => {
  return (
    <h1 id={id} className="text-4xl leading-tight dark:text-white">
      {children}
    </h1>
  );
};
```

And we can use this component within a `.astro` page like this:

```tsx
---
import { Title } from "../../components/title";
---
  <div class="flex row w-full gap-4 items-center mb-4">
    <Title id="hello">Ol√°! üëã</Title>
  </div>
```

## <span class="dark:text-white">Conclusion</span>

Astro allows me to work with React.js, Typescript and Tailwind in a very simple, quick-to-setup, and performant way. So far, I'm pleased with the development experience. As a result, the blog has great Lighthouse metrics without requiring much effort on my part to achieve:

<img src="/lighthouse.png" />

When I started writing this post, I was using an external CMS. However, to align with my philosophy of keeping things simple for this blog, I am now writing in `.md` files, which Astro's blog template already configures to work without any extra setup. I hope you enjoyed the content. My intention is to share my experiences, technical knowledge and learn more in the process. Thank you.

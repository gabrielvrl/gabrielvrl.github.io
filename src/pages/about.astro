        Welcome to my blog! <br />
      </p>

      <p class="dark:text-white">
        I'm a passionate Mobile Developer from Brazil with +5 years of
        experience in software development, focusing on creating high-quality
        mobile applications with React Native. I also have a strong background
        in front-end web development using ReactJS and Next.js.
      </p>

      <p class="dark:text-white">
        Iâ€™m driven by the opportunity to build impactful products that
        positively influence users and the world. For me, coding is not just a
        professionâ€”itâ€™s a way to transform ideas into real-world solutions that
        matter.
      </p>

      <p class="dark:text-white">
        I have hands-on experience with back-end development using Node.js, as
        well as Artificial Intelligence, particularly in an image processing
        project utilizing Python and machine learning techniques.
      </p>

      <p class="dark:text-white">
        I actively share my knowledge through my blog to help others in the
        developer community, believing that collaboration and continuous
        learning are key to growth and innovation.
